# Contributing to CFP11 2026 — C++ Engineering Project

This repository is used for the semester-end C++ engineering project for CFP11: Computer Fundamentals and Programming.

The goal is to develop a complete engineering program in C++ and use proper software-development workflow with GitHub.

**workflow: plan → code → test → commit → push → Pull Request**

Learning the GitHub workflow is part of the exercise.

## Before you start coding

You should have:

- a GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- a C++ compiler (g++, clang, or Visual C++)
- a code editor or IDE

### 1. Learn GitHub basics

Read the GitHub Learning guide:

- https://learn.github.com/

### 2. Understand your project

Read [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md).

Choose one of the P1–P10 engineering projects, or develop a qualifying P11 project.

No instructor approval is required for a proposed project.

Understand:

- The engineering problem
- Required inputs and outputs
- Key calculations and formulas
- Engineering assumptions and constraints
- What testing means for this project

### 3. Plan your program structure

Before coding, sketch out:

- What data will you need? (variables and arrays)
- What functions will you need?
- What does the main flow look like?
- Where do you need validation?
- How will you organize the program?

## Development workflow

### 1. Fork the repository

Click the **Fork** button to create your own copy on GitHub.

### 2. Clone your fork

Download your fork to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cfp11d2026.git
cd cfp11d2026
```

### 3. Create a branch

Create a branch for your project work:

```bash
git checkout -b my-project-name
```

Example branch name: `beam-calculator` or `circuit-analyzer`

### 4. Create your student folder

Create a folder with your **last name** for your project files:

```bash
mkdir LastName
cd LastName
```

All your C++ source code files (.cpp, .h) should go in this folder.

### 5. Develop your program

- Write your C++ program to solve the engineering problem.
- Place all source code files in your student folder.
- Compile regularly to catch errors early.
- Test with realistic inputs and boundary cases.

### 6. Compile and test

Compile your program (from your student folder):

```bash
g++ -o myprogram main.cpp
```

(Adjust the compiler and flags based on your setup.)

Test with:

- Normal engineering scenarios
- Boundary conditions (min/max valid values)
- Invalid inputs (negative when positive expected, zero when non-zero required, etc.)
- Verify calculations against hand calculations or reference values

### 7. Create your demo video

Create a maximum 3-minute video demonstrating your project.

**Save the video file in your student folder** (e.g., `LastName/demo.mp4`).

Your video should show:

1. The engineering problem
2. The completed program running
3. Important inputs and outputs
4. Important parts of the code
5. How calculations were tested or verified
6. What you learned or found challenging

### 8. Commit meaningful progress

Commit regularly, not just once at the end:

```bash
git add LastName/
git commit -m "Add input validation for beam properties"
```

Good commit messages:

- "Add structural analysis calculation"
- "Implement input validation"
- "Add engineering calculations for load analysis"
- "Test circuit analysis with realistic values"

Poor commit messages:

- "stuff"
- "fixed"
- "update"
- "final"

### 9. Push your branch

Push your work to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin my-project-name
```

### 10. Open a Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub.

Click "New Pull Request" and select your branch.

In the Pull Request description, explain:

**Project:** [Name of the engineering project]

**What I developed:**
[Brief description of what the program does]

**Engineering approach:**
[Key calculations, formulas, assumptions, design decisions]

**How I tested it:**
[Test cases used, including realistic cases and boundary conditions]

**Program structure:**
[Brief overview of functions and organization]

**Known limitations:**
[Any edge cases or constraints]

**Location of files:**
All source code and video are in the `LastName/` folder.

## Engineering quality expectations

### Code organization

- Write functions for logical blocks of code
- Avoid putting the entire program into `main()`
- Use meaningful function names (e.g., `calculateBeamStress()`, `validateInput()`)
- Keep functions focused on single tasks

### Documentation

Include comments explaining:

- What each function does
- Complex calculations or formulas
- Engineering assumptions
- Unit conventions (meters, kN, MPa, etc.)
- Validation criteria

Example:

```cpp
// Calculate bending stress using flexure formula: sigma = M * c / I
// where M = bending moment, c = distance to neutral axis, I = second moment
double stress = bendingMoment * distanceToNA / momentOfInertia;
```

### Variable names

Use clear, descriptive names:

```cpp
// Good
double beamLength;
double materialYieldStrength;
double safetyFactor;

// Avoid
double l;
double ys;
double sf;
```

### Input validation

Validate all user input:

```cpp
if (beamLength <= 0) {
    cerr << "Error: Beam length must be positive." << endl;
    return 1;
}
```

### Error handling

Handle errors gracefully:

- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use sensible defaults when appropriate
- Avoid crashing on invalid input

### Testing

Test your program with:

- **Normal cases**: typical engineering values
- **Boundary cases**: minimum and maximum valid values
- **Invalid input**: negative when positive expected, zero when non-zero required, etc.
- **Reference values**: verify calculations against hand calculations or known results

Document your testing in the Pull Request description.

## Pull Request checklist

Before submitting your Pull Request:

- [ ] Program compiles without errors
- [ ] Program runs and produces correct output
- [ ] Realistic test cases have been performed
- [ ] Boundary and invalid cases have been tested
- [ ] Important calculations have been verified
- [ ] Functions are used appropriately
- [ ] Code is readable and well organized
- [ ] Engineering formulas and assumptions are documented
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Student folder created with last name
- [ ] All source code in student folder
- [ ] Demo video in student folder
- [ ] Meaningful commit history is present
- [ ] Pull Request explains the project and testing

## Keep the code focused

This is an engineering project, not a software product.

Focus on:

- Solving the engineering problem correctly
- Using appropriate C++ concepts
- Clear, readable code
- Proper testing and validation

Do not add:

- external libraries (unless instructor approves)
- graphics or complex visualization
- web frameworks
- unnecessary complexity

A well-structured, thoroughly-tested engineering program is better than an elaborate but incomplete system.

## Questions or issues?

- Review the project description in [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md)
- Check [SUBMISSION.md](SUBMISSION.md) for submission requirements
- Ask your instructor for help

Good luck with your engineering project!
